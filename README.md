# Privacy Policy for The BagReminder

**Last Updated: January 17, 2026**

## Overview

The BagReminder ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
The BagReminder uses your device's location services to detect when you are near selected store locations. This is the core functionality of the app.

- **How it's used:** Location data is processed entirely on your device to determine proximity to stores and trigger reminders.
- **Storage:** Your location data is NOT stored, uploaded, or transmitted to any external servers.
- **Sharing:** We do NOT share your location data with any third parties.

### Locally Stored Preferences
The app stores the following data locally on your device only:
- Your selected store chains
- Alert distance preferences
- Streak counter data
- Pro upgrade purchase status

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Browsing history
- Contacts
- Photos
- Health data
- Financial information (purchases are handled securely by Apple)

## Third-Party Services

### Apple Services
- **In-App Purchases:** Processed securely through Apple. We do not have access to your payment information.
- **MapKit:** Used to identify store locations near you. Apple's privacy policy applies to their services.

### Analytics
BagReminder does NOT use any analytics or tracking services. We do not track your behavior or app usage.

## Data Security

All data remains on your device. Since we don't collect or transmit personal data, there is no risk of data breach from our servers.

## Children's Privacy

BagReminder does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences and does not target children.

## Your Choices

### Location Permissions
You can control location access at any time:
1. Go to Settings on your iPhone
2. Select Privacy & Security → Location Services
3. Find BagReminder and adjust permissions

Note: The app requires "Always" location permission to send reminders when you arrive at stores. If you select "While Using" or "Never," reminders will not work when the app is closed.

### Deleting Your Data
Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Uninstalling the app removes all associated data
- You can reset your streak in the app's Settings

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.
